                        The mighty edifice of Aga Khan Palace is situated in Pune and was built by Sultan Muhammed Shah
                        Aga Khan III in the year 1892. It is one of the most important landmarks in Indian history and
                        has been instrumental in many defining moments of India's independence. It was once the site
                        where Mahatma Gandhi, his wife Kasturba Gandhi, as well as Sarojini Naidu and Mahadev Desai were
                        held prisoners. Aga Khan Palace is well known both for its architectural excellence as well as
                        its historical significance. Spread over a vast land of 19 acres, the palace is now the
                        headquarters of the Gandhi National Memorial society. Here, making khadi is still one of the
                        prime activities.

                        The Sultan built the palace to support the poor in the neighbouring areas who were hit by a
                        famine. In the memory of Kasturba Gandhi and Mahadev Desai, architect Charles Corea had their
                        memorials built in the premises of the palace. The palace houses a museum which holds a rich
                        collection of pictures. There are also other items like the personal belongings of Gandhi. The
                        Palace also has the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi buried in its ground. In 2003, the monument was
                        declared to be of national importance.
