                        The Katraj Snake Park is the most visited and loved tourist attraction in the Rajiv Gandhi Zoo
                        that is located in Katraj, near the city of Pune in India. The Rajiv Gandhi is a famous and
                        grand zoo that is spread over an area of 130 acres and is managed by the Pune Municipal
                        Corporation. It is divided into three parts: the central zoo, an animal orphanage, and the most
                        famous of all: the Katraj Snake Park. The snake park has successfully managed to acquaint
                        thousands of visitors with the unusual and fascinating wildlife through its extensive collection
                        of snakes, reptiles, birds and turtles.

                        The Katraj Snake Park is a time-tested proof that fantastic and fun-filled places necessarily
                        need not be expensive. The snake park is home to over 22 species of snakes with ten species of
                        reptiles, that comprises of more than 150 individuals. This marvellous collection also includes
                        a 13-foot long king cobra. In 1986, Mr Neelam Kumar Khaire, who was the first director of the
                        park, with assistance from the Pune Municipal Corporation, had created the Katraj Snake Park on
                        the land that was to become the Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park later on. The park since then has
                        garnered thousands of nature enthusiasts and animal lovers.
