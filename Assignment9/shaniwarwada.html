                        The Shaniwar Wada, although ridden with tales of treachery and deceit, is one of the last
                        standing
                        testimonies to the grandeur, valour, and the just rule of the Peshwas. The entire old part of
                        the
                        city of Pune is laid out in a chaotic yet ironically, orderly fashion all around this historical
                        structure. It is around Shaniwar Wada that you will find the oldest markets of Pune including
                        Laxmi
                        Road, Tulshibaug, Ravivar Peth etc. It is said that on a full moon night the fort is haunted by
                        the
                        ghost of a former Peshwa king Narayanrao as he was murdered in the palace by his aunt and uncle
                        -
                        Anandi and Raghunathrao. However, there is not a shred of evidence to support such claims. So,
                        you
                        can get a glimpse of history and some drama as well! This was after all the site of the famed
                        romance between Peshwa Bajirao and Mastani Sahiba. In fact, one of the gates has also been named
                        after her!
