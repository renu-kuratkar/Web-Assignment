                        Road, Tulshibaug, Ravivar Peth etc. It is said that on a full moon night the fort is haunted by
                        the
                        ghost of a former Peshwa king Narayanrao as he was murdered in the palace by his aunt and uncle

                        Anandi and Raghunathrao. However, there is not a shred of evidence to support such claims. So,
                        you
                        can get a glimpse of history and some drama as well! This was after all the site of the famed
                        romance between Peshwa Bajirao and Mastani Sahiba. In fact, one of the gates has also been named

                        The mighty edifice of Aga Khan Palace is situated in Pune and was built by Sultan Muhammed Shah
                        Aga Khan III in the year 1892. It is one of the most important landmarks in Indian history and
                        has been instrumental in many defining moments of India's independence. It was once the site
                        where Mahatma Gandhi, his wife Kasturba Gandhi, as well as Sarojini Naidu and Mahadev Desai were
                        held prisoners. Aga Khan Palace is well known both for its architectural excellence as well as
                        its historical significance. Spread over a vast land of 19 acres, the palace is now the
                        headquarters of the Gandhi National Memorial society. Here, making khadi is still one of the
                        prime activities.

                    <p>
                        The Sultan built the palace to support the poor in the neighbouring areas who were hit by a
                        famine. In the memory of Kasturba Gandhi and Mahadev Desai, architect Charles Corea had their
                        memorials built in the premises of the palace. The palace houses a museum which holds a rich
                        collection of pictures. There are also other items like the personal belongings of Gandhi. The
                        Palace also has the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi buried in its ground. In 2003, the monument was
                        declared to be of national importance.

                        that is located in Katraj, near the city of Pune in India. The Rajiv Gandhi is a famous and
                        grand zoo that is spread over an area of 130 acres and is managed by the Pune Municipal
                        Corporation. It is divided into three parts: the central zoo, an animal orphanage, and the most
                        famous of all: the Katraj Snake Park. The snake park has successfully managed to acquaint
                        thousands of visitors with the unusual and fascinating wildlife through its extensive collection

                        The Katraj Snake Park is a time-tested proof that fantastic and fun-filled places necessarily
                        need not be expensive. The snake park is home to over 22 species of snakes with ten species of
                        reptiles, that comprises of more than 150 individuals. This marvellous collection also includes
                        a 13-foot long king cobra. In 1986, Mr Neelam Kumar Khaire, who was the first director of the
                        park, with assistance from the Pune Municipal Corporation, had created the Katraj Snake Park on
                        the land that was to become the Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park later on. The park since then has
                        garnered thousands of nature enthusiasts and animal lovers.
