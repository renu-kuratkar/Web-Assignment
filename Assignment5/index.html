                    Shaniwarwada, once the seat of the Peshwa governance in Pune is a 286-year-old mansion and is one of
                    the finest examples of architecture in the city. It is now one of the most popular tourist
                    destinations in Maharashtra. This grand mansion was built by the Peshwa Bajirao I himself as the
                    residence of the Peshwas. Although the Wada currently covers an area of 625 acres, in its heyday it
                    covered almost the entire area of the city itself. The place never fails to amaze the visitor with
                    its various forts and fountain, and the majestic statue of Baji Rao I that greets the visitor at the
                    entrance of the palace. Although most of the Wada was destroyed by an unexplained fire in 1828, what 
                    remains of it is equally thrilling and majestic.
